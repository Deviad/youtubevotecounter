At the moment this is for demonstrational purposes only.


## How to use

Get into project folder and run `yarn install`<br>
After that you can simply check package.json for all the available options.<br>
For a simple initial run you can use: `yarn start:tsnode -a <some_user_name> -u <some_link>`

## How it works
`<some_user_name>` will contain your username: asthe author of some video, before using this tool, for every video
inside a page you will leave a reply under under the most funny,engaging/interesting comments of your users.
For every one of this comment you can leave a vote by writing something like: 
`<name_of_the_user_being_voted> >> +<vote>`
This way you can automatize contests and you can loyalize your users rewarding them with some awards for being engaged, etc.
